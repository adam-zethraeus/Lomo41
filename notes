* possible underuse of GPUImage.
* shoot enabled before it's ready
* gallery doesn't refresh when image is added. noticable on quick switch after shots finalize.

# Ideas
* randomize filter effects within bounds
* constant filter states for an install
* shake to rerandomize filter states?
* preview of shot image
* tune dimensions to regular film
* progressively load gallery
* lines fade/brighten as shots are taken
* swipe on lines to change color & add overlay color to corresponding image

#Known Issues
* possible underuse of GPUImage.
* shoot enabled before it's ready
* flip animations happen to different images, apparently arbitrarily.
  - Don't use Cell for action, add proper sub views.

# Ideas
* randomize filter effects within bounds
* constant filter states for an install
* shake to rerandomize filter states?
* preview of shot image
* tune dimensions to regular film
* progressively load gallery

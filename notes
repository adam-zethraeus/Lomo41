#Known Issues
* possible underuse of GPUImage.
* Images are not set (or at least shared) with proper rotation information
* entering gallery page allocates - and does not deallocate once leaving - a lot of memory

# Ideas
* randomize filter effects within bounds
* constant filter states for an install
* shake to rerandomize filter states?
* tune dimensions to regular film
* progressively load gallery
* lines fade/brighten as shots are taken
* swipe on lines to change color & add overlay color to corresponding image
* consider locking focus after first picture (/toggle the mode)
* consider flash toggle

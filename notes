#Known Issues
* possible underuse of GPUImage.
* Images are not set (or at least shared) with proper rotation information
* entering gallery page allocates - and does not deallocate once leaving - a lot of memory
* At a fast enough exposure speed, the shutter sound clips are played in quick succession 
  and then the second or third one get cut off

# Ideas
* randomize filter effects within bounds
* constant filter states for an install
* shake to rerandomize filter states?
* tune dimensions to regular film
* progressively load gallery
* lines fade/brighten as shots are taken
* swipe on lines to change color & add overlay color to corresponding image
* consider locking focus after first picture (/toggle the mode)
* consider flash toggle
* consider using a empty sound clip on loop to disable shutter sound (if no music is already playing)
* swipe down to close from fullscreen (please?) the current way to do this from a hidden chrom is 2 taps
